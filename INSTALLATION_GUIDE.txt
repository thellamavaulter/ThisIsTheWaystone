ThisIsTheWaystone Plugin - Installation Guide
==============================================

REQUIREMENTS:
- ExileCore2 installed and working
- .NET 8.0 SDK (for building)
- Visual Studio 2022 or compatible IDE

INSTALLATION STEPS:
1. Extract the ThisIsTheWaystone-Plugin.zip file
2. Copy the entire "ThisIsTheWaystone" folder to your ExileCore2 Plugins\Source\ directory

4. Build the solution (Build > Build Solution)
5. The compiled plugin will appear in your ExileCore2 plugins list

IMPORTANT - DLL REFERENCE ISSUES:
If you get "ExileCore2 could not be found" errors when building:
1. Make sure your ExileCore2 installation has these DLLs in the main directory:
   - ExileCore2.dll
   - GameOffsets2.dll
   - ItemFilterLibrary.dll
2. The project file uses relative paths (..\..\..\) to find these DLLs
3. If the DLLs are in a different location, update the HintPath in ThisIsTheWaystone.csproj
4. Alternative: Copy the DLLs to your ExileCore2 main directory if they're missing
